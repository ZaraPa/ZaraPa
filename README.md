### Hey everyone! 👋  I'm Zara <br>
A Mathematician & Data Scientist 📈 specializing in 🧬 MEDICAL and 💲 FINANCIAL BIG DATA. <br>
Over the past 6 years I’ve been using ML and NLP to solve real world challenges.
<br>
<br>

###  🌟 &nbsp; What I’ve Been Working On: <br>
- &nbsp;  Built a **Netflix-style recommendation system** for insurance decision-making, now fully integrated. <br>
- &nbsp;  Developed an **NLP model** for risk assessment and sentiment analysis on millions of documents. <br>
- &nbsp;  Used **Mask R-CNN with ResNet-50** for instance segmentation in complex environments. <br>
- &nbsp;  Extracted insights from resumes using **MiniLM and transformer models**. <br>
- &nbsp;  Applied **IRT** for adaptive learning in personalized exams. <br>
- &nbsp;  Improved **financial forecasting** with transformer-based **time series analysis**, now in active use. <br>
- &nbsp;  Built a **RAG system with Mistral** for document-based interactions. <br>
- &nbsp;  Was **data manager of a medical startup** from the very beginning, working towards FDA approval. <br>

<br>

### 🍎 &nbsp; What I’m Up To Now: 
- &nbsp; Developing **statistical models for analyzing and interpreting financial data**. <br>
- &nbsp; Conducting **NLP research** on AI medical sensing at HIT Institute of Technology. <br>
- &nbsp; One of the **guides for RAG-focused WiDS workshop**, sharing expertise and its applications. <br>
<br>

### 🦫&nbsp; A fun fact - 
My brother lives abroad, and we make it a point to have an annual family reunion in a different location each time. <br>
