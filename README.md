# Hey all! My name is Zara👋

## 🌱 &nbsp; I'm a Mathematician - Data Scientist.<br>
   For the past 6 years, I’ve been turning complex data into impactful solutions.<br>
   Specializing in **Medical** and **Financial Big data**. <br>
<br>

##  🌟 &nbsp; What I’ve Been Working On: <br>
- &nbsp;  **Insurance Decision-Making**: Built a Netflix-style recommendation system to streamline decision-making processes. <br>
  &nbsp;  The system has been fully integrated and is actively in use.
- &nbsp;  **Document Analysis**: Developed an NLP model for risk assessment and sentiment analysis, handling millions of documents. <br>
- &nbsp;  **Object Detection**: Conducted instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN with ResNet-50, <br>
  &nbsp; solving detection challenges in complex environments.
- &nbsp;  **Resume Insights**: Extracted valuable insights from resumes using MiniLM and transformer-based models. <br>
- &nbsp;  **Adaptive Learning**: Applied Item Response Theory (IRT) to create personalized learning paths for adaptive exams. <br>
- &nbsp;  **Financial Forecasting**: Used transformer models for time series analysis to improve financial predictions. <br>
  &nbsp;  This solution is currently in active use.
- &nbsp;  **RAG and Mistral Model**: Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for interaction with document-based data. <br>


## 🍎 &nbsp; What I’m Up To Now: 
- &nbsp; Developing **statistical models for analyzing and interpreting financial data**. <br>
- &nbsp; Conducting **NLP research** on AI medical sensing at HIT Institute of Technology. <br>
- &nbsp; One of the **guides for RAG-focused WiDS workshop**, sharing expertise and its applications. <br>
<br>

## 🦫&nbsp; A fun fact - 
My brother lives abroad, and we make it a point to have an annual family reunion in a different location each time. <br>
<br>
<br>
